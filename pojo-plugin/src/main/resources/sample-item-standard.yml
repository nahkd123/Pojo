# Pojo Sample Item (Standard)
# This is the standard variant of Pojo custom items, and likely the only one in
# Pojo (unless nahkd cooked something).
# This variant is based on components system, where you can plug in what you
# want, like adding gemstone slots for example.

# A list of components
# Components are applied from top to bottom.
# Each component can be named to whatever you like, but they must be unique for
# each component definition.
components:
  # Add pojo:display component
  # Note that other components under this may modify the display.
  Display:
    type: "pojo:display"
    # The Bukkit material name. For list of materials, see org.bukkit.Material.
    material: IRON_SWORD
    # The localized name of the item. This is not the same as "display name".
    # Localized names are special kind of name that allows player to rename
    # their item.
    # The item ID is actually stored inside item's "NBT".
    name: "&eSample Blade"
    # Note that "lore" in this component will set the "pojo:custom" section of
    # the lore. To set different section, use "pojo:add_lore", "pojo_set_lore"
    # or "pojo:remove_lore" component.
    # Sections other than "custom" might be automatically generated. For more
    # information, please see the component's documentations.
    lore:
    - "&7&oA special blade crafted with cares."
  # Since we are making a sword, we need to tell Pojo that this is a sword.
  # Other types can be added by other plugins.
  # Type name is automatically added into "pojo:type" lore section.
